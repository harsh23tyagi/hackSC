bsmARt- Smart Augmenting Reality - A picture of the future

This porject was a 26 hours hack in the HackSC 2019 hackathon which won the **Facebook's Favorite Product award**.
This works on the mysteries of Internet of Things and controlling those networking protocols via Augmenting Reality.


## Introduction:
We know evolution is the key to success and being smart is synonymous to evolution in today's epoch. It's not just everyone who wants to be smart, it is every THING that wants to be smart... And that became our inspiration, to make everything around us smart and making it fun using facebook's Augmenting Reality- Spark Studio. Our vision originated with the thought, that in the near future we all will be augmenting our eyes with some or the other kind of AR devices and therefore creating utilities for tomorrow would not just be fun but important as well.


## What the hack does?
In the near future augmenting reality shall take over our lives not just in the form of snapchat filters and games, but it shall span through a bunch of different sectors such as healthcare, defense, education, transport etc. Thus, we have created a utility based Augmented Reality application, that controls automated appliances and vehicles over Internet of Things.


## Tech. Stack Used:
- Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol for Internet of Things
- Node.js (with express: For creating a publisher/subscriber model)
- Raspberry Pi 3 with Python script
- Facebook's Spark AR Studio for creating an application based front end and using Augmenting Reality

## Information about the Repo:
- The repo contains the AR module which can only be opened in the AR studio, which creates the entire front end and controls for the augmenting reality
- Other than that, the module contains a node.js application which runs the entire backend.
- The code is again not that good as it was made as a hack, but the idea is
- There is also a python file that is not in this repo which controlled the LED on Raspberry Pi using the MQTT subscriber module
